## Abstract
Existing ways to access movie data exist in varying and fragmented locations on the internet. Lack of readability and visualization for these movie data resources prevent users from gaining insight into their favorite movies, producers, and actors. We have created a comprehensive one-stop-shop movie data application with the intention of visualizing and compiling data in a user-friendly and unique way in order to provide movie lovers with a novel perspective on data in the film industry.

## Work distribution

The work was evenly distributed between team members. Carol was in charge of the Streamlit application whereas Vivian spent most of her time on the movie colors visualization app created using Node.js. 

Initially, Carol took on the responsibility of gathering informal survey data pertaining to the process of searching for new movies and notable attributes of movie data that users were interested in.

For the Streamlit application, Carol's responsibilities included querying and cleaning the API data in addition to developing the interactive charts and graphs used to visualize the film data. Vivian's responsibilities included similar API data retrieval + manipulation as well as developing the interactive movie colors app and deploying on Heroku. In addition, Vivian finalized the design of both applications in order to have a cohesive style across the two sections. 

Carol created the framework for our final paper and contributed the text regarding her sections of the project whereas Vivian finalized the paper by inserting sections pertaining to the movie colors app and revising the paper as a whole.

The final project video was a joint effort as well. After receiving Carol's recording walking through the introduction of our project and the Streamlit app, Vivian added recordings and voiceover of the movie colors app demo and edited the video to completion.
